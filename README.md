# Introduction of the code

This script is a basic script that gives the users a flavour on to the basics of Classification model.
The modelling is done using SVM - Support Vector Machines - using Cross Validation as well as not using cross validation.
We also use the Confusion matrix (which is a popular way to test the false positive and false negative test results in Classification problems)
Almost all the procedures are explained within the script in the comments.
